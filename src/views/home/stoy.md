Start

After more than 8 years of aikido, our teacher shared his wish for the next couple of years; He wanted us to take over the dojo and he wanted to move slowly to a life in France. One of these aspects included the sale of his house in France. And with house, it was more of a renovated shed on a large plot of land at a desolated area in the Auvergne. He had some beautifull pictures to share about this house and the surroundings. So all I did was open these on a website and leave this in our living room.

First visit

Titia and I talk a lot, so naturally the topic living in a different country was touched beforehand, but dismissed just as quick. But after viewing the pictures and getting an image in our mind about how we could live there a few ideas were growing. Aaah, this is what you mean by living in another country. Now having the ability to imagine what we can do with such a place instead of living in the middle of a city, comparable to our live in the Netherlands.

That became more clear when we visited for the first time. After discussing our interest with the owner, we we`re generously allowed for a visit of a couple of weeks. The first week we stayed in a caravan that`s part of the sale, the other weeks we stayed at the house, while the current owner went on an adventure to buy another property in France.

So what is this place? About 6.5 acre of land, mostly forrest at the lower sides of a hill. Once the whole area was used for the cultivation of wine, after a disease it was used to plant tame kastanjes and now it is one of the lesser inhibited areas of France. So what once was a farm, now slowly is becoming a forrest again. A few hundred meters above us, is Casou, a small village, and a few kilometers further Saint Amans des Cots, a village with your basic needs. About 100 metres down is the river Gouzou, which flows through the whole year, in the winter this becomes quite the torrent. In summer still more than just a stream. Throughout the plot of land there are some ruins that were houses. At the moment the only house that can be lived in is standing on an area that has been semi-cleared; some trees have been cut down for more sunlight, and one side of the hill is cleared to give a view to Campouriez, which lies about 5km to the west. This house is an upgraded shed, first used for cattle and starting from about 20 years ago it has received some upgrades to be used as a summerhouse. The french word for shed is grange, so from now on...

It takes a bit of effort to run around. A path has been cleared for cars from the main road to the grange, but it certainly has a slope. With a normal car you are not advised to take it, because you might not be able to get back up again. On feet it is a brisk walk that if you go down is no problem. Up it will take you double the time. With a wheelbarrow with luggage it will leave you sweating and out of breath.

We explored the plot itself, there are some man-made and wildlife trails. The man-made ones you need to prune once in a while to keep them available. On our first days we were told to discover the trail to the waterfall. After a few hours with a large pruning scissor and a saw we were introduced to 2 large waterfalls next to each other. Not deafening, but not soft neither. A lovely sight and site where you`re able to spend some time. The way back was 15 minutes because we took so much time clearing it the first time.

There are no fences, you`ll see some deserted landmarks and old rows of stoned that are up to your waist. But not a clear divider of terrain like you see in the suburbs or farms. You can just wander onto the next property without you knowing it, you are in a forrest. There are a few other placed to discover of the terrain. Later...

What more? There is a stream from a source, about 10.000 litre per day. We know this because there is a 10.000 water tank on the top of the terrain. That is a lot and little at the same time. More than enough for showering and watering the plants that surround the house. But it will give you 20 minutes of water pressure that can be transformed into power. If we want to do something like that we would need to turn to the Gouzou. For now we dont want to drink the water of the source, first test it. If it passes, we will filter it and will lay down a water hose to the house.

Around the house are a few plants but nothing like a vegetable or fruit garden. The closest supermarktet is a 10 minute walk and a 10 minute drive. A serious supermarket and tools are at a 40 minute drive. Our closest neightbours are at a 10 minute walk.

Intermezzo

After the first visit we doubted; is this for us? Is this for us... now? No. So we told this to the owner and went home. The next year it kept coming up as a point of interest. Could we, should we... We decided we wanted to go for it, otherwise it would stay a thing you would want to do, like a scab being ready to be torn of. We talked with the owner and arranged that we could stay there for some time again the next year.

After a few conversations and some planning our plans took shape and we decided to be there at the end of the summer. The owner told us a few other people were going to come looking at the place as well. We werent that scared because you must have quite specific needs to be willing to buy this place and take care of it. Far away from the Netherlands, pretty desolated, not for the weak and faint-hearted, be able to DIY, have free time to actually be there for at least? 6, 8 weeks per year to be able to maintain it.

But then we talked with the owner again, it was a good conversation, but basically what he told us is that he needed the money and that he would sell it to the first people that would say yes.... We had a yaer to prepare us and think about it. After talking it through we decided to not let this chance slip away and proposed to buy it without the second visit.

This led to the other interested canceling their trip, but we still visisted that year and arranged the sale with a down-payment and some basic agreements about the who pays what, which contractor and when...

Second visit

The first visit was three weeks, the second six, the third will be close to 12... This time we drove in one go. We wanted to make a stop somewhere and camp a bit. But from about half of the trip till the end it was pourring, so we decided to buckle up and finish in one go. We started drving for real around 16:00 and got there around 06:00, seeing a huge wild boar just a few hundred meters from where we live.

This time the visit feels less like a vacation, and more like our home. We prepared for this. Packing the car like pro`s (you are a pro not when you pack neatly, but when you remove the back seats to make more space). Using years of tetris experience to meticulously stack a mix of canned goods, tools and basics. Upon arrival we scout around and notice a few things:
Some trees have fallen on the path to the waterfall. Some trees on other places are fallen. There are a few too many ants inside.
